                        <p>In the restricted three-body problem, a body of negligible mass (the "planetoid") moves under the influence of two massive bodies. Having negligible mass, the planetoid exerts force on the two massive bodies that may be neglected; therefore the resulting system can be analyzed and described as a two-body motion problem.[3][5] With respect to a rotating reference frame, the two co-orbiting bodies are stationary, and the third can be stationary as well at the Lagrangian points, or move around them, for instance on a horseshoe orbit. It can be useful to consider the effective potential. Usually this two-body motion is taken to consist of circular orbits around the center of mass, and the planetoid is assumed to move in the plane defined by the circular orbits.</p>
                        <p>The restricted three-body problem is easier to analyze theoretically than the full problem. It is of practical interest as well since it accurately describes many real-world problems, the most important example being the Earth–Moon–Sun system. For these reasons, it has occupied an important role in the historical development of the three-body problem.</p>
                        <p>Mathematically, the problem is stated as follows. Let m 1 , 2 {\displaystyle m_{1,2}} be the masses of the two massive bodies, with (planar) coordinates ( x 1 , y 1 ) {\displaystyle (x_{1},y_{1})} and ( x 2 , y 2 ) {\displaystyle (x_{2},y_{2})}, and let ( x , y ) {\displaystyle (x,y)} be the coordinates of the planetoid. For simplicity, choose units such that the distance between the two massive bodies, as well as the gravitational constant, are both equal to 1 {\displaystyle 1}. Then, the motion of the planetoid is given</p>
